## RP2350 test board

Now that JLCPCB have stock of RP2350s, here's a test board.  It's designed around the RP2350B and, I think, follows the 
guidance in the RPi hardware design guide.  With one exception: given the length of the USB lines, I've made no attempt 
to impedance match them.

I've put this together as a starting point for me to build on and for others, so I'm licensing this broadly under 
CC BY 4.0 - details here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1

As a starting point, it doesn't have much on it - one LED (as, of course, a blinking LED is proof of concept) and a
header connected to 8 GPIOs.  That's by design.

Any and all feedback, good or bad, is welcome - david.knell@gmail.com will find me.  All use is at your own risk.

Tested and working as 2025-02-27.
